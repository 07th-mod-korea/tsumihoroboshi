# Known issues (for fixing)

- [ ] in _tsum_001.txt, line 248 slightly mismatches. Might be unchanged on PS2
- [ ] in _tsum_001.txt, line 770 has no voice (for some reason)
- [ ] in _tsum_002_2.txt, lines 253 to 271 have no voices
- [ ] in _tsum_003_3.txt, line 938 has no voice. Most likely on PS2
- [ ] in _tsum_005.txt, line 1144 has no voice. Looks like a random cut that might be in the PS2 voices
- [ ] in _tsum_006.txt, lines 404 to 419 are missing a few voices. Text was toned down a bit
- [ ] in _tsum_007.txt, big chunks of the script has no voices (especially the first 1000 lines). Search for ``PlaySE(4, "", 128, 64);`` for all of them
- [ ] in _tsum_008.txt, line 1932, the text was changed from "I'm pregnant" to "He's proposed to me" (paraphrasing, of course). PS2 might have the correct voice
- [ ] in _tsum_008.txt, lines 1982 and 1988, both voices were changed to match the previous change. Same PS2 case might applies here
- [ ] in _tsum_008.txt, line 2014, line has no voice because it was toned down
- [ ] in _tsum_009.txt, line 34, the voice was changed to match the change made in the previous chapter (_tsum_008.txt, line 1932)
- [ ] in _tsum_010.txt, line 2038 for some reason is not voiced
- [ ] in _tsum_010.txt, line 2358 was cut from the PS3 release
- [ ] in _tsum_011.txt, line 1486 doesn't entirely match with the PS3 script
- [ ] in _tsum_011.txt, lines 1647, 1667, 1673, 1762, 1765, 1768, 2002 are for some reason absent in the PS3 release
- [ ] in _tsum_013.txt, line 1630 was toned down. PS2 is probably uncensored
- [ ] in _tsum_016.txt, lines 799, 802 and 810 were cut from the PS3 release
- [ ] in _tsum_016.txt, lines 823, 827 and 1684 were toned down significantly
- [ ] in _tsum_020.txt, lines 1620 and 1623 were cut from the PS3 release
- [ ] in _tsum_021.txt, lines 2050, 2068 and 2101 was toned down significantly
- [ ] in _tsum_021.txt, lines 2090 and 2093 were cut from the PS3 release

- [ ] in _tsum_023_1.txt, line 538 was changed in the console release
- [ ] in _tsum_024_1.txt, lines 935 to 964 have no voices
